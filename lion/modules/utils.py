    Sort a batch of padded variable length sequences by length.
    Args:
        batch: A batch of padded variable length sequences. The batch should
            have the dimensions (batch_size x max_sequence_length x *).
        sequences_lengths: A tensor containing the lengths of the sequences in the
            input batch. The tensor should be of size (batch_size).
        descending: A boolean value indicating whether to sort the sequences
            by their lengths in descending order. Defaults to True.
    Returns:
        sorted_batch: A tensor containing the input batch reordered by
            sequences lengths.
        sorted_seq_lens: A tensor containing the sorted lengths of the
            sequences in the input batch.
        sorting_idx: A tensor containing the indices used to permute the input
            batch in order to get 'sorted_batch'.
        restoration_idx: A tensor containing the indices that can be used to
            restore the order of the sequences in 'sorted_batch' so that it
            matches the input batch.
