    RNN taking variable length padded sequences of vectors as input and
    encoding them into padded sequences of vectors of the same length.

    This module is useful to handle batches of padded sequences of vectors
    that have different lengths and that need to be passed through a RNN.
    The sequences are sorted in descending order of their lengths, packed,
    passed through the RNN, and the resulting sequences are then padded and
    permuted back to the original order of the input sequences.
